1. Files are chunks of data, be it a binary you can execute or user/application data.
   A folder is a hierarchical way to organize and store files and other folders (which presumably contain files).

2. Subfolders (also known as subdirectories) are essentially a folder inside a folder.
   Eg. bin is a subfolder in /usr , at /usr/bin

3. Click and drag is a feature implemented by most desktop environments & file managers on Linux/Windows/OS X.
   To move a file or shortcut to an application you merely click and hold the object while dragging it to where you intend for it to go.

4. Double click as commonly referred to is pressing your left mouse button twice.
   Depending on the context, double clicking can minimize/maximize a window.
   On Windows double clicking is used to run applications/open files.

5. File extension are essentially a convenient way to broadly represent what a file should contain.
   Eg. a .json , .csv or  .xml file should contain formatted data.
   Meanwhile, a .py or .sh file can be executed and edited as needed.
