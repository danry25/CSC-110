Assignment 9: Presidents

The first thing I did was work on parsing my file into a list. I started out with a couple extra 
if statements that were totally unneeded, but eventually cleaned those up. I did a minor amount of planning
prior to starting to code this assignment. All 3 files seem to be generated correctly, so everything looks
to work.

I think this assignment taught me to use return statements, as outside of codingbat I had yet to use them
(surprisingly). The one thing I'd do differently next time is start earlier. I've been rather shabby in
this regard as of late, giving myself just enough time to (hopefully) do the assignment.
