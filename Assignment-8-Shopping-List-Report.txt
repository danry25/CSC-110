Assignment 8: Shopping List Report

The approach I took on this assignment was to go and flesh out each function, step by step and get it
fully working, to the point that it would meet the Standard & Challenge criteria. I think I accomplished
this goal, as the program seems to be fully functional, including file storage and decent error handling.

This assignment taught me quite a bit about file handling, and how simple mistakes like /n instead of \n
can eat hours of your time if you don't catch them early on. Next time perhaps switching focus from
working on one function to another might be a better choice than spending significant amounts of time at
an impasse, where fresh eyes and a clear head would allow you to see most of the issues rather quickly.
