Assignment 6 - There was an Old Lady
I began this assignment by pulling in the chunks of code that my teacher required I include in my program.
I then analysed the structure of the poem and broke it down into the relevant repetitive pieces. From
there I was able to build a fully functional program, and learned that you can leverage functions quite heavily
to knock out repetitive chunks of an issue, rather than writing single use boilerplate code for every little subsection
of a program.

I think the largest change I'd make next time would be to not cut corners on reading through the initial assignment page,
as that nearly got me (yet again) this time. Gotta stay within the scope of the assignment!
