Assignment 2 - Height Converter Report

I built my height conversion script to a minimum viable product, using other works
I've written as a reference when stuck. Once the initial height conversion from imperial
to metric was done, I moved straight to the challenge version of the script after reading
what was required of the standard and minimal variants.

Testing of my program was all done by hand, had this program been more complex I'd automate 
testing so as to make the best use of my time.

The script I wrote is fairly minimal, no exception handling, basic integer validation
for user input, and while it fully covers the task at hand, I would hate to put it in
a scenario where it affected anyone besides myself.

This assignment showed me that sometimes it is best to think around the issue, rather
than directly solve it. What I mean by this is rather than taking a ton of time to
figure out rounding, a simple adding or subtraction of a small amount (1/16th in this case)
allowed me to avoid using if statements and anything terribly complex. Next time, I
intend to fully read the assignment prior to beginning it, and perhaps plan out what portions
need research, which I can dive right into, and then proceed from that place of knowledge.
