Assignment 10: Prime factors

To kick off this assignment, I built a quick MVP with all of the code not in functions. I then
went and tested its functionality (and generated reference/baseline data), looked at what I
needed to accomplish for the standard & challenge versions, and refactored my program into the
required functions. Overall, not a bad approach, and it allowed me to get rubber on the road
rapidly while verifying that everything worked.

I think the only change I'd make in the future is to either have people knowledgeable in the
topic at hand (Prime factorization) easily accessible, or educate oneself in that area so as to
gain an understanding of it. As is, I'm reading up and waiting to hear back from a family friend
who is a math professor. Should have contacted her sooner!

For the vast majority of numbers, esp. in our range of 1000 to -1000, the factors are either
within the first 11, or after being fully divided by those 11 factors, are left a prime
remainder. I think the only things that may need to change for a much broader range of inputs
would be adding perhaps a few more primes and changing the warnings in my script.

Test cases:
    12: 2, 2, 3
    60: 2, 2, 3, 5
    82: 2, 41
    820: 2, 2, 5, 41
    934: 2, 467
    952: 2, 2, 2, 7, 17
    -329: -1, 7, 47
    -845: -1, 5, 13, 13
    -909: -1, 3, 3, 101
