1) What change needs to be made to the code, other than just adding the fill argument?

To colorize and fill these shapes, I had to move the circle function in between where the
rectangle and polygon are called to be drawn, I also ended up changing the circle function
into an oval function so I could complete the standard version.

2) Why is this necessary?

If the circle call is not moved between the rectangle and rotated inner rectangle calls, the
circle will be covered by the outer rectangle entirely.
