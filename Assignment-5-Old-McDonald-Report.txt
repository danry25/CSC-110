Assignment 5 - Old McDonald

How did you approach (get started with) this assignment?
To start this assignment, I built a list of requirements and built a rough initial version and then committed,
then proceeded to build the standard & challenge versions atop this base. I tested my program by running it
through some of the examples provided, and it seemed to cover the use case that was defined. So far everything
works, though I've only tested it a few dozen times.

This assignment really taught me how to fully work with functions and global variables, as I had forgotten how
to pass parameters & global variables into a function.
